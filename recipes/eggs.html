    <h7>Yum yum Deviled Eggs</h7>
    <em>Can't beat a good deviled egg from Yum Yum! I like to pair a few with a nice Firecap soup on those rainy nights.</em>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons milk </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon parsley</li>
        <li>One gren onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dill weed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
       
        <li>Place the eggs in a pot of cold water. Make sure not to overcrowd them </li>
        <li>Heat over medium heat until the water starts to boil. Shut off the heat and cover the pot with a secure lid. Allow the eggs to sit for ten minutes in the water.</li>
        <li>Remove the eggs and allow them to cool before peeling.</li>
        <li>Slice the peeled eggs in half. Remove the yolks and arrange the whites on a large baking sheet or plate.</li>
        <li>Add the yolks and all the other ingredients to a large plastic storage bag and knead together until well mixed. (Alternately you can mix it all in a bowl and spoon the filling into the whites.)</li>
        <li>Cut off a small corner of the bag and pipe the yolk mixture into the whites. Sprinkle with paprika. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
        <li>You can print off this label if you are serving these at a video game-themed party or want to gift them to someone.</li>
    </ol>
