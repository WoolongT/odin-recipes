    <h1>Nuka Cola Quantum</h1>
    <em>These bad boys are incredibly difficult to find out there in the wastes these days; the REAL Quantums that is. A trader by the name of Moira gave me a recipe after saving her skin against a molerat attack. Tastes close to the real thing, but you just can't beat a genuine Nuka Cola. Said she has a shop in someplace called "Megaton". May be worth to check it out.</em>
