    <em>Strawberry Lemonade Margaritas are a refreshing summer take on your standard margarita.  They combine all the flavors of summertime, tart lemons and sweet, juicy strawberries with the always popular margarita. A quick and easy adult cocktail to make for two or a crowd.</em>
    <p>Lemonade is the perfect refreshing drink for summer but these deliciously fresh and bright Strawberry Lemonade Margaritas are even better!</p>
    <p>Anyone that likes margaritas, especially strawberry margaritas, will love this version. They're so easy to make too! All you do is combine a little frozen concentrated lemonade with fresh strawberries, a little mint, and the usual tequila and triple sec.</p>
    <p>This drink is more sweet than tart so the rim of the glass is coated with coarse sugar instead of salt. I also added some silver decorating sugar just to give it a little more pizazz! Doesn't it look pretty? Now check out just how easy this summery cocktail is to make.</p>
