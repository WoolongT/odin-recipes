        <h1>Ted's Mirelurk Cakes</h1>
        <em>Mirelurk cakes. Mmmm, somewhat similar to the crab cakes I used to eat on the beaches. *sigh* That was ocean city, before the bombs fell. This recipe shares a warm place in my heart as it reminds me of my hometown, Olney. Hopefully it shares a warm place in your stomach :) </em>
