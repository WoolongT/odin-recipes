    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Place butter into a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and swirl butter in pan to melt butter. Continue to swirl pan while butter bubbles and cooks. Watch carefully as butter browns. When butter is brown, carefully pour into a heat proof bowl, scraping brown bits from pan too. Let butter cool for 30 minutes or you can place in refrigerator for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Preheat oven to 330 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place brown butter into a large mixing bowl. Stir in brown sugar and granulated, stirring until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla stirring until well combined. Stir in flour, baking soda and salt. Stir until dough forms then add white chocolate chips stirring until combined.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Place sugar and cinnamon into a shallow bowl, stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Step 4: Scoop cookie dough with a medium size cookie scoop and gently roll into cinnamon/sugar mixture. I don’t roll dough into balls before cinnamon/sugar, just regular cookie scoop shape. Place onto baking sheet 1 inch apart and bake for 10-11 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes before transferring to a serving plate.</li>
